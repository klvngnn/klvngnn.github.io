    <p>It's likely no secret that I really dig Clojure. It's the first unityped language I've used since Objective-C in the early 90s that I really like. Yes, I still love Scala, but I think Clojure is pretty much the best designed computer language I've ever used... and maybe that's because Clojure is mostly "less is more" but in a few places, it's not. The things I really like about Clojure are:</p>

    <p>For much of the work that I do, the Java Virtual Machine is the best thing since sliced bread. It's performant, predictable, and has a very nice ecosystem of libraries. But the JVM really needs at least 128MB of RAM just to print "Hello World" and any non-trivial code needs a process size of 512MB and most of the code I work with, the JVM needs 2GB of RAM to work reasonably well. And the JVM has the slowest startup time of any runtime I've ever encountered. So, if you've got the RAM, the JVM ultimately gives you the performance. But that's not always what I want.</p>
