  <h2>Week 3: My Thinking Style and Learning</h2>
  <h4> 2015/3/15 </h4>

    <p>For this week's cultural blog, I will be discussing my thinking style and the growth and fixed mindset.</p>

    <p>On the personal thinking style I scored 12 for Concrete Sequencial (CS), 20 for Abstract Sequencial (AS), 44 for Abstract Random (AR), and 44 for Concrete Random (CR). After reading the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> Gregoric Thinking Style</a> more indepth, I agree with how the chart categorizes my thinking style.</p>

    <p>Although there are conflicting qualities for AR and CR thinking styles, since I scored the same for both categories, I feel that it's a combination of both for me.</p>

    <p>Starting from learner likes, I feel that I have the qualities of: </p>
        <ul>
          <lh>Concrete Random</lh>
            <li>Experimenting to find answers.</li>
            <li>Taking risks</li>
            <li>Using my intuition</li>
            <li>Solving problems independently</li>

          <lh>Abstract Random</lh>
            <li>Listening to others</li>
            <li>Bringing Harmony to the Group</li>
            <li>Establishing Healthy Connections</li>
            <li>Focusing on the issue at hand</li>
          </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>In the learns best section, I feel that I have the qualities of: </p>
          <ul>
          <lh>Concrete Random</lh>
            <li>When I'm able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
            <li>Able to compete with others</li>
            <li>Using my intuition</li>
            <li>Given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves</li>

          <lh>Abstract Random</lh>
            <li>Working in a personalized environment</li>
            <li>Able to participate in group activites</li>
          </ul>
    <p>I agree with the following statements about what's hard for me: </p>
          <ul>
          <lh>Concrete Random</lh>
            <li>Restrictions and limitations</li>
            <li>Formal Reports</li>
            <li>Routines</li>
            <li>Re-doing anything once it's done</li>
            <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
            <li>Showing how I arrived at an answer</li>

          <lh>Abstract Random</lh>
            <li>Competition</li>
            <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
            <li>Giving exact details</li>
          </ul>

      <p>After going through the list, and reflecting, I've noticed I've struggled really hard with keeping to a study routine and strictly meeting the deadline for handing in my work. I think mostly this has been due to the way it's hard for me getting back into a study habit after being out of school for nearly four years.</p>
      <p>I enjoy coding, because I can often type something out, and immediately test it in irb to see whether the method I wrote works. However, a lot of times, I get side tracked during the trial-and-error and lose a lot of time.</p>

      <p>I think I've been procrastinating far too hard for the reading portions during past 3 weeks, I plan to try to finish all the reading by wednesday, so I stop missing the deadline by a few hours every Sunday. I need to trump the resistance to reading the dry material and just power through it.</p>

      <p>Contemplating about fixed and growth mindset... I think I'm very fixed in terms of how I want people to see me and how I see other people. I've always in some aspect flaunted events I thought were sucesses to make me seem smarter, without actually becoming intellectually smarter. But they were in reality events that have caused me to lose integrity, to lie, or to lose out on the opportunity to become intellectually smarter.</p>

      <p>I have, however, despite those events have some qualities of a growth mind-set, as I am very determined to figureout the correct answer for questions that baffle me, as to not make the same mistake again. Although this has become harder outside of an academic environment.</p>

      <p>This blog entry has made me reflect on the time I've spent in phase 0, and was really useful for me in establishing how I will be learning in the next 18 weeks. klvngnn out.</p>
