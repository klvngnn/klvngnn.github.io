        I learned how to build computers and took my first intro to computer science class while I was in highschool. The thrill of opening and fitting new hardware in a shinny case has always been exciting for me. I was always in awe of people that were great at coding, but I was lazy and never took the time to sit down and learn how to code myself.

        I first read about DBC while I was in college, I thought it was a pretty cool idea, becoming a world class beginner in just nine weeks. The thought was thrown in the back of my mind as I forged on to finish my political science degree at Purdue University. During and after college, I worked several jobs that were not very engaging and didn't seem to have very high ceilings. All through out these jobs people would come to me to ask technical questions, or maintain/create content for their websites. After contemplating about the future and seeing the correlation between the current economy and the things that I like to do, learning to code seemed to be the logical situation.

        After watching the video, I feel Shereef touched on the core of what I felt education was to me for the last 16 years of my life. I've walked into all my education with the attitude of "yo, My parents are paying the tuition bill, so I'm gonna just get grades, but not really learn anything." The fireside chat was a kind and genuine reminder that I need to be responsible for the experience I receive at Dev Bootcamp. This excites me and scares me at the same time. But I feel that this is the best kind of environment for me to learn in, with peers to constantly motivate myself.

        I'm glad I took the leap and joined the 2015 skippers, and I am grateful that I've been accepted into the program.
