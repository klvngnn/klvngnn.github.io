  <h2>Week 8: Conflict</h2>
  <h4>2015/4/18</h4>

  <section>
    <p>This week for the cultural blog, I'll be talking about conflict:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</li>
      <li>2. What was the source of the conflict?</li>
      <li>3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</li>
      <li>4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</li>
      <li>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
      <li>6. What did you learn from this experience?</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>Given the example from the prompt page, and I'm sure anyone that has had roommates have similar experiences, my roommates in college never took out the trash despite the trashbag being full. The situation was so bad, they leaned the trash can next to the wall, and continued to pile the trash into the trash can. I was always the one taking out the trash.</p>
    <p>The conflict was that I was pissed that these roommates must have been blind. Could they not see that the trash was overflowing? Was it really so hard to walk 150 meters to the dumpster and toss out the trash when they went out to smoke? The basic conflict was that these people that could clearly see the overflowing trash needed to just take the trash out to the dumpster and dispose of it.</p>
    <p>This was during my younger years, so upon analyzing the situation, I still felt anger, but I knew that I shouldn't be the only one taking out the trash. This needed to be a group effort.</p>
    <p>Still angry, I told my roommates that since they were not blind, they needed to take out the trash when it's overflowing, and not lean it toward the wall and keep piling on trash. Otherwise, I would dump the trash into their rooms, over their heads, and kick their asses. Although I was not the biggest guy in the room, I guess I was pretty intimidating. The trash can was never full again. They took out the trash before the bag was even half empty. Since we split the trash bag cost... I guess it wasn't too big of a deal.</p>
    <p>If I could go back, I guess I would have asked in a nicer way, without the threats. But prior to the threats, they still would not take out the trash, and as a common living area, this was unacceptable, and something needed to be changed.</p>
    <p>From this experience I learned that despite identifying the conflict, and understanding the emotions that I have toward this conflict, the conflict still needs to be solved. In the example given, although the woman identified what caused her anger, It wasn't clear whether she solved the problem of dirty dishes being piled in the sink. The hygene problem still stands. It would be best of people were receptive of being asked nicely. But some people just need to feel the negative reprecussions of their behavior to correct their actions.</p>
