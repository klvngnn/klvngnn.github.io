  <h2>Week 1: Learning Git</h2>
  <h4> 2015/3/1 </h4>

        Just started out with Dev Bootcamp! In the first week of phase 0, I learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control. This is a super useful method to keep track of changes in projects! Although it was tough learning the command line to use Git, DBC did a really good job of providing material for learning. Here is my attempt ast using words to describe what I learned this week.

        What is version control? Judging from just the words, version control is controlling the versions of your project. It keeps track of files and remembers when and where all of the changes were made. If a catastrophic bug was introduced into the code, version control allows the code to be rolled back to an earlier, less buggy version.

        The version control that DBC is teaching us, and is currently one of the more popular Version Controls, is Git. It is a simple to use software that is installed on to the local computer, and can be run by the command line. Git helps keep track of changes by viewing code files like a “tree” and allows "branches" to be created, where code can be worked on without affecting the “trunk” code base until the changes made are good and won’t break the rest of the "tree". After the tree has grown, the code can be shared on GitHub.

        What is GitHub? Does it have anything to do with Git? That was the questions I asked myself when I first heard of these two different things. Git is a software that is installed on your computer, GitHub is an online repository that stores the code that is shown to public, or needs to be worked on with others. So one is is software, and the other is a web-based community. It's good to store code on GitHub so people can work on it, and also in case of a hardware failure, there is a back up on a remore server.

        That is all I have to say for now in my first tech blog.
