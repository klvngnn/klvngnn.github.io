  <h1>Cultural Blog #5</h1>
  <h2>Week 6: Stereo Type Threat</h2>
  <h4>2015/04/06</h4>

  <section>
    <p>For this week's cultural blog, I'll be talking about what I felt during pairing sessions and some of the feedback I've gotten.</p>

    <h3>Pairing</h3>

    <h4>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h4>
    <p>Overall, it's been really nice pairing with people to solve challenges, because I can bounce my ideas off my pair. However, sometimes it feels uneasy/awkward for me when both of us lack the technical knowledge to complete the challenge.</p>

    <h4>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h4>
    <p>It's fun and rewarding when you pair is talktive and share the same interests as me. Not to mention when they're super good at coding and the problem just flies by. But then again, Christmas only comes once a year.</p>

    <h4>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h4>
    <p>I tend to like to avoid confrontation or uneasy situations. With these harder ruby concepts these last two weeks, I've had to pair into situations where I don't immediately have the answer. I wouldn't say that it's frustrating, but I'd say it's kind of difficult for me to tread into unknown waters and get out of my comfort zone. However, my pairs and I have been able to look up information that we need and solve the challenge. Although I don't like it, I understand that the difficult is necessary for me to know where I'm lacking in my knowledge. Again, X'mas only comes once a year.</p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <h4>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h4>
    <p>Overall pretty good, people are nice. But it might be because those were from easier challenges.</p>

    <h4>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning</h4>
    <p>Ironically, its the challenges that were difficult that allowed my pair to be specific on the areas we were lacking. So ya, it was helpful toward my learning.</p>

    <h4>Based on the feedback you've recieved, what are you going to improve the next time you pair?</h4>
    <p>I would improve upon further increasing my knowledge of ruby, and to think aloud more.</p>

    <h4>How was it to write feedbac?</h4>
    <p>Based on my feedback reviews, I'd say I need to be more specific on what my peers need to improve upon.</p>

    <h4>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h4>
    <p> Procrastinating and not writing the feedback immediately, causing me to forget what happened in the pairing session.</p>

    <p>I think that's it for now, klvn out</p>
