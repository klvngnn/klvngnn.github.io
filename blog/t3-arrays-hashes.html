  <h2>Week 3: Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4> 2015/3/15 </h4>

    <p>This week in phase0, I learned about Arrays and Hashes, and when to use them in different situations. The following describes and compares both; some examples are also included: </p>

    <p>An Array can be thought of as a list; a collection of data in some kind of order. Any piece of data can be looked up by using the number corresponding to it on the list.</p>

    <p>If had a list of things we needed to do, and we put them in an array:</p>

    <p><code>things_to_do = ['code', 'yoga', 'eat'] </code></p>

    <p>We could look up the third thing by typing <code>things_to_do[2]</code> it would give us <code>eat</code> "But, Kelvin! You typed in 2 instead of 3, how does that give us the third thing?"</p>

    <p>Well, because in an array, the first thing refered to is always 0. It's just how computers count things :-D</p>

   <p>A hash can be thought of as a collection of pairs of information, and each pair is made of a name and a value. The name is called a key, and it must be unique. The key is used to return the value paired to it. This generally gives a more detailed view of items.</p> 

   <p>For example, in a shopping list, a hash could give you specifically what you need when you type in a generalized item:</p>

   <div id="codeblock">
    <code>shopping_list = {'fish' => 'Tilapia',</code>
    <code><p> </p></code>
    <code>    'milk' => '2%'</code>
    <code><p> </p></code>
    <code>    'sweets' => 'chocolate'</code>
    <code><p> </p></code>
    <code>  }</code>
  </div>

  <p>So in this hash, the keys are the generalized items, if you type in <code>shopping_list['sweets']</code> it should return <code>chocolate</code>, nifty huh!</p>

<p> Both array and hash are similar in the fact that they both store and retrieve date.</p>

<p> They differ in the way that you use to look up and retrieve data. At least for the exercises that's how I feel that they differ mostly. One other thing is that Arrays seem to work better in compling and computing data.</p>

<p> Thats it for now, klvn out</p>
